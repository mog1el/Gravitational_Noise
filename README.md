## Gavitational noise

A project that simulates the gravitational noise over the years, created by multiple neutron stars orbitting. I've used real-world equations to show how such noise is formed. The systems are created in a completely random state, meaning that there is almost no chance that two of them will be set up at the exact same angle, making it a truly randomized simulation that portrays the real world.

---

In order to run the simulation, after changing something in the `gravity_noise.pyx` file, you have to first compile it using Cython, by running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`. After that is complete, you can run the command `python -c "import gravity_noise; gravity_noise.letsgo(total_time=1e4, spawn_time=1e3, dt=1e-4, spawnchunks=2, filename='output.csv')"` (of course you can and should change the values accordingly to your needs. If not done, default values will be used.).

---

The simulation uses chunks in order to make it accessible for every computer. This can be adjusted by the `spawnchunks` variable that tells the code the amount of segments that should create one spawn_time (before new star arises). It can be, when utilizing large numbers, useful to offload the RAM.

---

In the simulation there is a constant dt that determines the amount of small fragments that time will be cut into. To get better (more acurate) results, you can lower the number. It, however, increases the number of calculations made by the computer, prolonging the time of completion. 

#### WARNING!

With a dt that is too large, the simulation will be completely screwed up, create a comically large value at the beginning and then suddenly moving to almost 0 (due to improper scaling). This makes the computation completely useless. The dt = 0.0005 works perfectly for me, but you can always change it however you want. Please, however, after adjusting dt, adjust it in `noise_csv.py` file.

The constants total_time and spawn_time, seen at the top of the gravity_noise.py resemble the total time of the simulation and the time before creation of the next binary system. Those can be changed

For the code to work, some dependencies are necessary. To install them, run  `pip install numpy csv math random` . After doing this and downloading the python file, you are ready to go.
